> A statically typed version of Arcthird with more coherent, organized and helpful code.

[Arcsecond](https://github.com/francisrstokes/arcsecond) is a simple parsing library inspired by Haskell's [Parsec](https://wiki.haskell.org/Parsec), made from scratch by francisrstrokes who runs the [LLJS](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC56l7uZA209tlPTVOJiJ8Tw) YouTube channel.

**Arcsquared** makes it more abstract by introducing a new class called `PStream`, from which your parsers are gonna parse. This allows for example to make a parser of tokens, represented as JS objects.

The code will be self-documenting, and I will be adding pieces of documentation while rewriting this library along the way.

I also intend this new version to have proper error handling.
